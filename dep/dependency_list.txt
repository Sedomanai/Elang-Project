 This git had decided not to bother with how you install your dependencies.

 Normally this directory has had a bunch of directory submodules but ever since switching to vcpkg there disappeared any need for it.
 I personally use vcpkg, but you can use conan or manually build them from scratch via pulling their sources.

 The current list of dependency is as follows: 

	entt:x64-windows                                  3.11.1              Gaming meets modern C++ - a fast and reliable en...

	tweeny:x64-windows                                3.2.0#1             A modern C++ tweening library
	
Qt/SDL is optional. If you need the GUI utils then you need Qt. 
If you need the engine.cpp for non-gui standalones then SDL.

The rest is mandatory for this engine.
	
!! THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION !!
 Unfortunately, fpng has neither a vcpkg nor a conan registration. 
 In fact, while it does seem to support cmake, the recommended way is to actually copy paste its source/header files.
 I'm considering just having the fpng sources in my src folder but I didn't check the license requirements yet.

 Therefore, I'm leaving fpng hub in the dep folder. The root CMakeList.txt will handle installing it for you. For now.
