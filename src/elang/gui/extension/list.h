 *		   The functionalities of some of the built-in QT widgets is either not enough or requires a workaround.
 *		   This extension not only helps extend those functionalities, it also provides a catch-all interface
 *		   that does not require one inheriting from either the base QT class or this class.

	 * The reason for that is actually consistency - there were some cases where QSignals and QSlots cannot satisfy.
