		* This is good when you're about to close the application and check whether you need to save all such modified files.
		* @brief --
		* @brief * Be warned that this also includes AssetConflict attached assets. 
		* AssetConflict happens when the original file was also modified externally or the original file was erased.
		* Since all AssetConflict assets will have an AssetModified attached to them, this method will also save them as well.
		* This can mean that erased files will be recreated, or that all external changes in the original file will be lost.
		* AssetConflict should probably be resolved on the fly whenever the GUI Application receives focus, but still deserves caution.
